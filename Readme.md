Phi* 2D
=======

2D Implementation of the paper by Nash and Koenig 
[_Incremental Phi star, incremental any-angle path planning on grids_](https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1021&context=grasp_papers)
using Python, Numpy and Matplotlib.

To run the simulation use:

```shell script
# Run the simulation with the Phi* path planning algorithm
python phi_star.py


# Run the simulation with the Theta* path planning algorithm
python theta_star.py
```

To configure the setup of the simulation, you can edit the `config.py` file.

## Performance analysis with Theta*
